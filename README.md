# Bird-Life
I'm currently making a text-based bird game :)


In this game you will be able to start off with 4 diffrent playable bird species: The house wren, turkey vulture, white-tailed eagle, and ruby-throated hummingbird. 

You can either be male or female, and each gender has different stories and attributes to go along with them. 

It isn't that well written, but everything is based off of true information and realistic behavours that could happen in the wild. 

This is HEAVILY a w.i.p, and nowhere near finsihed. 

If you have any bird ideas, submit them in the google forms below! :D
